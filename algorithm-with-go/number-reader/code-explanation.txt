This approach is ideal to process required program. 
1. Splitting the string parameter based on dot(.) Mark into array of string
2. We can see in the first index it has prefix Dollars, in the second index it has prefix cents 
3. To Read numbers into word we can iterate through how many characters of the string. if 
    1, it must be unit only 
    2, it must be dozens
    3, it must be hundreds
    4. it must be thousands
